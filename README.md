## 👦 **About me**

I am a Brazilian computer engineer living in Lisbon, Portugal. I have been working with technology since 2015 and during this period of my professional life, I have worked with the most diversified types of projects such as: **back-end**, **mobile** and **DevOps**.

In my opinion, the best project ever to develop is always the next one. I love challenges, learning new skills and programming languages. I believe that there is always space to improve ourselves.

I have two main **goals**:

The **first one**: developing web and mobile softwares to help and meet the needs of my customers.

The **second one**: transmit my knowledge. The same way that I have learned and still learning, which is from others experiences through their lessons and tutorials. I want to transmit my knowledge and why not transform someone's life at the same time?

## 🌱 Are you working on any side projects right now?

**Yes**. I'm doing a project called **[Homuai][homuai-url]**. It's a free app (.NET MAUI) and API (.NET Core 6) with the primary purpose of helping people that lives together to be more organized. It will help people improve their organization and domestic tasks around their house.

Life can get busy and sometimes we forget things like: paying the rent; going to the supermarket and letting the products expire in the fridge. When I was living with some friends (three to be more specific) and sometimes hard to keep everything organized amoung us. At that time I did not find a good App that really suited my needs, so I thought: why can’t I make it **myself** to solve this issue?

## 🎤 What languages do you speak?

I speak **Portuguese** as my mother tongue and have a high level of **English** and **French**. We can have nice conversations in those three languages so, don't hesitate to choose one of those to talk with me 😄.

Let me tell you ... I study a lot 😅. I read books, articles and watch tutorials on YouTube. You can also find me playing tennis, travelling or taking photographs to share on my Instagram profile.
