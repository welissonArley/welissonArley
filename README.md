## 👦 **About me**

I'm a Brazilian computer engineer living in Lisbon, Portugal. I have been working with technology since 2015 and during this period of my professional life, I have worked with the most diversified types of projects such as: **back-end**, **mobile** and **DevOps**.

If you were to ask me about my favorite project that I've ever worked on, I would always say that it's the one coming next. I believe that each new project comes with its own unique set of challenges and opportunities for growth. I believe that there is always space to improve ourselves.

I have two main **goals**:

**My first goal** is to leverage my skills as a web and mobile software developer to help make people's lives easier.

**My second goal** is to share my knowledge, much like how I have acquired and continue to acquire knowledge through the experiences, lessons, and tutorials of others. I aspire to pass on my knowledge and, if possible, make a positive impact on someone's life.

### 🖥️ **Animation 2D with Toon Boom Harmony.**

## 🌱 Are you working on any side projects right now?

**Yes**. I'm doing a project called **[Homuai][homuai-url]**. It's a free app (.NET MAUI) and API (.NET Core 7) with the primary purpose of helping those who lives with friends or family! Homuai is designed to make their life easier by helping they stay organized, manage their finances, and make cohabitation life more enjoyable.

When I was living with three friends was tough when it came to keeping things organized between us. I couldn't find an app that met our needs, so I decided to take matters into my own hands and create a solution myself.

## 🎤 What languages do you speak?

I speak **Portuguese** as my mother tongue and have a high level of **English** and **French**. We can have nice conversations in those three languages so, don't hesitate to choose one of those to talk with me 😄.

## 🍿 In my free time I like:

Let me tell you ... I study a lot 😅. I read books, articles and watch tutorials on YouTube. You can also find me playing tennis, travelling or taking photographs to share on my Instagram profile.
